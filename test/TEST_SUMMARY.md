## Test Quality Indicators

### ✅ Strengths:
1. **Comprehensive coverage** of cache, network, and repository layers
2. **Performance validation** with concrete time thresholds
3. **Error resilience** testing (corrupted data, network failures)
4. **Resource management** validation (disposal, cleanup)
5. **Scalability testing** (100+ device stress tests)
6. **Real-world scenarios** (stale data, empty cache, corrupted entries)

### 🎯 Best Practices Applied:
- Proper setUp/tearDown lifecycle
- Async test handling with Future.delayed coordination
- Mock implementations for isolated testing
- Performance benchmarking with Stopwatch
- Metrics validation (hit ratio, stats)
- Stream subscription cleanup
- Edge case handling (empty, corrupted, stale data)

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

### Additional Tests to Consider:
1. **Adaptive Sync Manager Tests** (partially attempted)
   - Complex Riverpod provider override patterns needed
   - Requires mock StateNotifier implementation
   
2. **Reconnection Manager Tests**
   - Exponential backoff timing (5s → 10s → 20s → 40s → 60s max)
   - Retry count tracking
   - Connection status integration

3. **Integration Tests**
   - End-to-end cache → network → sync flow
   - Multi-device concurrent updates
   - Offline-to-online transition scenarios
