# Refresh Button Enhancement

## Overview
Enhanced the circular refresh button on the map page to provide visual feedback and proper data refresh functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Loading State
- Added `_isRefreshing` boolean state variable to track refresh progress
- Located in `_MapPageState` class

### 2. Enhanced Refresh Logic
The refresh button now:
- Shows a loading spinner while refreshing
- Prevents multiple simultaneous refresh requests
- Performs comprehensive data refresh:
  1. Refreshes device list from Traccar backend
  2. Triggers `refreshAll()` on VehicleDataRepository 
  3. Fetches all device positions via `fetchMultipleDevices()`
- Shows success/error feedback via SnackBar
- Properly handles mounted state to prevent memory leaks

### 3. Updated _ActionButton Widget
- Added `isLoading` parameter (default: false)
- When loading:
  - Displays a circular progress indicator instead of the icon
  - Disables button interaction
  - Maintains proper sizing (22×22 pixels)
  - Uses the same color scheme as the icon

## User Experience

### Before
- Clicking refresh had no visual feedback
- Users couldn't tell if refresh was in progress
- No confirmation of success/failure

### After
- Circular progress indicator appears when refresh starts
- Button is disabled during refresh to prevent double-taps
- Green success SnackBar shown on completion ("Data refreshed successfully")
- Red error SnackBar shown if refresh fails with error details
- Refresh completes in 1-3 seconds typically

## Technical Implementation

### Refresh Flow
```dart
1. User taps refresh button
2. setState(() => _isRefreshing = true)
3. Refresh devices list (await)
4. Call repo.refreshAll()
5. Fetch all device positions (await)
6. Show success SnackBar
7. setState(() => _isRefreshing = false)
```

### Error Handling
- Try-catch-finally structure ensures loading state is always cleared
- Mounted checks prevent setState after widget disposal
- User-friendly error messages in SnackBar

### Loading Indicator
- Circular progress indicator with 2.5px stroke width
- Same color as the icon (black87 or black26 for disabled)
- Same 22×22 size as the icon for consistent layout

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Basic Refresh**
   - Tap refresh button
   - Verify spinner appears
   - Confirm markers update
   - Check success message

2. **Error Handling**
   - Disconnect network
   - Tap refresh
   - Verify error message appears

3. **Double-Tap Prevention**
   - Tap refresh quickly twice
   - Verify only one refresh occurs

4. **State Management**
   - Refresh while navigating away
   - Verify no errors in console

## Files Modified
- `lib/features/map/view/map_page.dart`
  - Added `_isRefreshing` state
  - Enhanced refresh button logic
  - Updated `_ActionButton` widget
