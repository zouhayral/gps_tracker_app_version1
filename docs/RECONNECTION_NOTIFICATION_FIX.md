# Reconnection Notification Fix - Complete Solution

## Date: October 28, 2025
## Issue: Missed notifications after long disconnections

---

## 🐛 Problem Description

**User Report:**
> "The devices sending notification ignition on/off... I don't receive them when I connected my phone back. While it was not connected for a long time, I don't receive past notifications."

**Root Cause Analysis:**

1. **Short notification window**: The notification system only showed backfilled events within a 30-minute window
2. **No explicit refresh trigger**: When phone reconnected to internet, there was no explicit call to refresh and show missed notifications
3. **WebSocket backfill alone insufficient**: While WebSocket backfill was working, it wasn't explicitly fetching and showing notifications for missed events

**Impact:**
- Users disconnected for more than 30 minutes would miss critical notifications (ignition on/off, device offline, etc.)
- Notifications were cached but not displayed after reconnection
- Poor user experience for monitoring critical vehicle events

---

## ✅ Solution Implementation

### 1. Extended Notification Window (2 Hours)

**File**: `lib/repositories/notifications_repository.dart`

**Change**: Increased backfill notification window from 30 minutes to 2 hours

```dart
// BEFORE (30 minutes)
final notificationWindow = DateTime.now().subtract(const Duration(minutes: 30));

// AFTER (2 hours)
final notificationWindow = DateTime.now().subtract(const Duration(hours: 2));
```

**Benefit**: Users will now receive notifications for events that occurred up to 2 hours before reconnection, covering most realistic disconnection scenarios.

---

### 2. New `refreshAfterReconnect()` Method

**File**: `lib/repositories/notifications_repository.dart`

**Added**: Dedicated method to fetch and process missed events after reconnection

```dart
/// Refresh events after reconnection
///
/// Fetches events that occurred during disconnection and shows notifications
/// for critical events. This is triggered by the connectivity provider when
/// the phone reconnects to the internet.
Future<void> refreshAfterReconnect() async {
  try {
    _log('🔄 Refreshing events after reconnection');

    // Get the timestamp of the last processed event (replay anchor)
    final lastEventTime = _lastReplayAnchor ?? 
                         await getLatestEventTimestamp() ?? 
                         DateTime.now().subtract(const Duration(hours: 2));

    // Fetch events since last anchor (with 5-minute safety margin)
    final safeFrom = lastEventTime.subtract(const Duration(minutes: 5));
    final to = DateTime.now();

    _log('📆 Fetching missed events from $safeFrom to $to');

    // Fetch events from API
    final freshEvents = await _eventService.fetchEvents(
      from: safeFrom,
      to: to,
    );

    _log('✅ Fetched ${freshEvents.length} events after reconnection');

    if (freshEvents.isEmpty) {
      _log('⏭️ No missed events during disconnection');
      return;
    }

    // Process each event through the normal pipeline to show notifications
    for (final event in freshEvents) {
      await addEvent(event);
    }

    // Reload cache to update UI
    await _loadCachedEvents();

    _log('✅ Reconnection refresh complete: ${freshEvents.length} events processed');
  } catch (e) {
    _log('❌ Failed to refresh after reconnect: $e');
  }
}
```

**Key Features**:
- Uses replay anchor for precise event fetching
- Falls back to latest cached event timestamp
- Processes events through `addEvent()` to trigger notifications
- Reloads cache to update notifications page immediately
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

---

### 3. Connectivity Provider Integration

**File**: `lib/providers/connectivity_provider.dart`

**Added**: Import for notifications provider

```dart
import 'package:my_app_gps/providers/notification_providers.dart';
```

**Modified**: `_onReconnect()` method to trigger notification refresh

```dart
/// Handle transition to online state
void _onReconnect() {
  if (kDebugMode) {
    debugPrint('[CONNECTIVITY_PROVIDER] 🌐 Switching to FMTC normal mode');
  }

  // Resume WebSocket when back online
  try {
    _ref.read(webSocketManagerProvider.notifier).resume();
  } catch (e) {
    if (kDebugMode) {
      debugPrint('[CONNECTIVITY_PROVIDER] ⚠️ Failed to resume WebSocket: $e');
    }
  }

  // 🎯 NEW: Trigger notifications refresh to fetch missed events
  Future<void>.microtask(() async {
    try {
      final notificationsRepo = await _ref.read(notificationsRepositoryProvider.future);
      await notificationsRepo.refreshAfterReconnect();
      if (kDebugMode) {
        debugPrint('[CONNECTIVITY_PROVIDER] 🔔 Triggered notifications refresh');
      }
    } catch (e) {
      if (kDebugMode) {
        debugPrint('[CONNECTIVITY_PROVIDER] ⚠️ Failed to refresh notifications: $e');
      }
    }
  });

  // Trigger map rebuild to refresh tiles and resume live markers
}
```

**Why `Future.microtask()`?**
- Avoids blocking the reconnection flow
- Runs asynchronously after current event loop
- Properly handles the async nature of the FutureProvider
- Ensures WebSocket resumes immediately while notification refresh happens in background

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Short Disconnection (< 30 minutes)

**Steps**:
1. Turn on airplane mode
2. Trigger device event (ignition on/off)
3. Wait 5 minutes
4. Turn off airplane mode
5. Wait for app to reconnect

**Expected Result**: ✅
- Notification appears immediately
- Event shows in notifications page
- Log shows: `[CONNECTIVITY_PROVIDER] 🔔 Triggered notifications refresh`
- Log shows: `[NotificationsRepository] ✅ Fetched X events after reconnection`

---

### Test 2: Long Disconnection (30 min - 2 hours)

**Steps**:
1. Turn on airplane mode
2. Trigger multiple device events over 1 hour
3. Keep phone offline for 1 hour
4. Turn off airplane mode
5. Wait for app to reconnect

**Expected Result**: ✅
- All missed notifications appear (within 2-hour window)
- Batch summary shown if > 3 notifications
- All events visible in notifications page
- Log shows: `[NotificationsRepository] 🔔 Showing X notifications (Y recent, Z older unread)`

---

### Test 3: Very Long Disconnection (> 2 hours)

**Steps**:
1. Turn on airplane mode
2. Trigger events at various times:
   - Event A: 3 hours ago (outside window)
   - Event B: 1.5 hours ago (inside window)
   - Event C: 30 minutes ago (inside window)
3. Turn off airplane mode
4. Wait for reconnection

**Expected Result**: ⚠️
- Events B and C: Notifications shown ✅
- Event A: No notification (outside 2-hour window) ⚠️
- All events still visible in notifications page ✅
- Users can manually check notifications page for older events

---

### Test 4: Multiple Events During Disconnection

**Steps**:
1. Turn on airplane mode
2. Trigger 10+ different events:
   - Ignition on/off
   - Device offline/online
   - Geofence enter/exit
   - Overspeed
3. Turn off airplane mode

**Expected Result**: ✅
- Individual notifications for first 3 events
- Batch summary notification: "You have 10 new notifications"
- All events visible in notifications page sorted by time
- No duplicate notifications

---

## 📊 Performance Considerations

### API Load
- **Single fetch call** per reconnection (not per device)
- **Time-bounded query** (max 2 hours)
- **Batched processing** via `addEvent()` deduplication
- **Cached replay anchor** for precise queries

### Memory Usage
- Events processed **one at a time** through addEvent()
- **Deduplication** via `_recentEventIds` set
- **Auto-pruning** of dedup set (max 1000 entries)
- **Persistent dedup** saved to SharedPreferences

### User Experience
- **Non-blocking** refresh (runs in microtask)
- **WebSocket resumes immediately** (no wait)
- **Background processing** of missed events
- **Progressive UI updates** as events are processed

## 🔍 Debug Logging

### Key Log Messages

**Reconnection Triggered:**
```
[CONNECTIVITY_PROVIDER] 🟢 RECONNECTED after 120s
[CONNECTIVITY_PROVIDER] 🔔 Triggered notifications refresh
```

**Fetching Missed Events:**
```
[NotificationsRepository] 🔄 Refreshing events after reconnection
[NotificationsRepository] 📆 Fetching missed events from 2025-10-28 14:30:00 to 2025-10-28 16:30:00
[NotificationsRepository] ✅ Fetched 5 events after reconnection
```

**Processing Events:**
```
[NotificationsRepository] addEvent called for ignitionoff
[NotificationsRepository] 📤 Showing notification for backfilled event: ignitionoff (Device 1)
[LocalNotificationService] 📤 Showing notification for event: ignitionoff
```

**Completion:**
```
[NotificationsRepository] ✅ Reconnection refresh complete: 5 events processed
```

## 🚨 Error Handling

### Network Errors
```dart
catch (e) {
  _log('❌ Failed to refresh after reconnect: $e');
  // Fallback: Events will still be fetched on next WebSocket message
  // or next manual refresh (pull-to-refresh)
}
```

### No Replay Anchor
```dart
final lastEventTime = _lastReplayAnchor ?? 
                     await getLatestEventTimestamp() ?? 
                     DateTime.now().subtract(const Duration(hours: 2));
```
- Falls back to latest cached event
- Falls back to 2-hour window if no cache
- Ensures no events are missed

### Provider Not Initialized
```dart
try {
  final notificationsRepo = await _ref.read(notificationsRepositoryProvider.future);
  await notificationsRepo.refreshAfterReconnect();
} catch (e) {
  // Gracefully handle if provider not ready
  debugPrint('[CONNECTIVITY_PROVIDER] ⚠️ Failed to refresh notifications: $e');
}
```

## 📝 Configuration Options

### Adjustable Parameters

**Notification Window** (currently 2 hours):
```dart
// In _showNotificationsForEvents()
final notificationWindow = DateTime.now().subtract(const Duration(hours: 2));
```
- Increase for longer coverage (e.g., 6 hours, 24 hours)
- Decrease for battery/performance optimization
- Consider user preference setting

**Safety Margin** (currently 5 minutes):
```dart
// In refreshAfterReconnect()
final safeFrom = lastEventTime.subtract(const Duration(minutes: 5));
```
- Accounts for clock skew between device and server
- Prevents edge case event loss
- Can be reduced if server time is perfectly synced

**Max Backfill Window** (currently 2 hours):
```dart
// In refreshAfterReconnect()
DateTime.now().subtract(const Duration(hours: 2))
```
- Maximum time range for initial query if no replay anchor
- Balances coverage vs API load
- Matches notification window duration

---

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

### 1. User Preference for Notification Window
```dart
// Add to Settings page
final notificationWindow = prefs.getInt('notification_window_hours') ?? 2;
```

### 2. Batch Notification Optimization
```dart
// Group similar events (e.g., multiple ignition on/off)
if (events.length > 10) {
  await LocalNotificationService.instance.showBatchSummary(
    events,
    groupBy: 'type', // Group by event type
  );
}
```

### 3. Persistent Notification Queue
```dart
// Store unshown notifications in ObjectBox if app was closed during disconnection
class NotificationQueue {
  final List<Event> pendingNotifications;
  final DateTime lastShownTimestamp;
}
```

### 4. Smart Notification Throttling
```dart
// Avoid notification spam during reconnection
if (events.length > 20) {
  // Show only critical events (alarms, overspeed)
  // Summarize others
}
```
