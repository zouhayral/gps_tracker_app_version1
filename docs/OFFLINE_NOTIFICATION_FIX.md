# Offline Notification Recovery Fix

## Problem Statement

**Issue**: When the phone connection is lost and then restored, users don't see notifications for events that occurred during the disconnection period, even though the app properly backfills those events.

**User Report**: "when my phone connection is dead, i dont find pass notification while i open app and connection retourne"

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue had multiple contributing factors:

### 1. **Read Status Filter**
- The `_showNotificationsForEvents` method only showed notifications for events where `!event.isRead`
- Backfilled events from the database might already be marked as read
- Result: Notifications were suppressed for events that happened during disconnection

### 2. **Duplicate Event Detection**
- The `_recentEventIds` set is persisted across app restarts via SharedPreferences
- When the app restarts after losing connection, backfilled events are recognized as duplicates
- The `addEvent` method would skip processing these events entirely
- Result: No notifications shown for events that occurred during offline period

### 3. **No Time-Based Filtering**
- There was no mechanism to prioritize recent events over older ones
- Both fresh backfilled events and old cached events were treated the same
- Result: Important recent events could be missed while old events were processed

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Time-Window Based Notification Display** ‚úÖ

Modified `_showNotificationsForEvents` to show notifications for recent events (within 30 minutes) regardless of read status:

```dart
// Time window for showing notifications on backfilled events
final notificationWindow = DateTime.now().subtract(const Duration(minutes: 30));

// Recent events (within 30 min) should show regardless of read status
final isRecent = event.timestamp.isAfter(notificationWindow);
if (isRecent) {
  return true; // Show notification for recent events
}

// Older events only if unread
return !event.isRead;
```

**Benefits**:
- Ensures critical events from the last 30 minutes are always shown
- Prevents notification spam from old events
- Balances between completeness and user experience

### 2. **Smart Duplicate Handling** ‚úÖ

Modified `addEvent` to handle recent duplicates specially:

```dart
// For recent events (within last hour), bypass duplicate check
final oneHourAgo = DateTime.now().subtract(const Duration(hours: 1));
final isRecent = event.timestamp.isAfter(oneHourAgo);

// Deduplicate by id (but allow recent events through for notifications)
if (_recentEventIds.contains(event.id) && !isRecent) {
  _log('üîÅ Skipping duplicate addEvent ${event.id} (older than 1h)');
  return;
}

// For recent events that are duplicates, still show notification but skip caching
final isDuplicate = _recentEventIds.contains(event.id);
if (isDuplicate && isRecent) {
  _log('üîÑ Processing recent duplicate event ${event.id} for notifications only');
  await _showNotificationsForEvents([enriched]);
  return; // Skip re-caching
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Recent events (< 1 hour old) always get notification display, even if duplicate
- Prevents unnecessary re-caching of duplicate events
- Maintains data integrity while ensuring user visibility

### 3. **Enhanced Logging** ‚úÖ

Added detailed logging for debugging and monitoring:

```dart
// Log breakdown of recent vs older events
final recentCount = notifiableEvents.where(
  (e) => e.timestamp.isAfter(notificationWindow)
).length;
_log('üîî Showing ${notifiableEvents.length} notifications ($recentCount recent, ${notifiableEvents.length - recentCount} older unread)');

// Log when showing backfilled events
if (isRecent && event.isRead) {
  _log('üì§ Showing notification for backfilled event: ${event.type} (${event.deviceName})');
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Easy to trace notification behavior in logs
- Helps identify issues with backfill processing
- Provides metrics on recent vs old notifications

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Short Disconnection (< 30 min)
**Steps**:
1. Turn on airplane mode
2. Trigger an event (ignition off, geofence entry, etc.)
3. Wait 5 minutes
4. Turn off airplane mode and open app
5. Wait for WebSocket reconnection

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ
- Event is backfilled from API
- Notification is shown immediately
- Event appears in notifications list
- Banner notification displays

**Log Trace**:
```
[VehicleRepo] üîÑ Reconnected ‚Äî backfilling events
[VehicleRepo] ‚úÖ Replayed 1 missed events
[NotificationsRepository] addEvent called for ignitionOff
[NotificationsRepository] üîÑ Processing recent duplicate event
[NotificationsRepository] üîî Showing 1 notifications (1 recent, 0 older unread)
[NotificationsRepository] üì§ Showing notification for backfilled event: ignitionOff (Device Name)
[LocalNotificationService] üì§ Showing notification for event: ignitionOff
```

### Scenario 2: Medium Disconnection (30-60 min)
**Steps**:
1. Turn on airplane mode
2. Trigger multiple events
3. Wait 45 minutes
4. Turn off airplane mode and open app

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ
- Events within last 30 min get notifications
- Older events (30-60 min ago) only if marked unread
- All events appear in notifications list

### Scenario 3: Long Disconnection (> 1 hour)
**Steps**:
1. Turn on airplane mode
2. Trigger events
3. Wait 2 hours
4. Turn off airplane mode and open app

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ
- Duplicate detection applies for all old events
- Only unread events show notifications
- Prevents notification spam from old events
- All events visible in notifications list

### Scenario 4: App Restart After Disconnection
**Steps**:
1. Lose connection
2. Events occur on server
3. Close app completely
4. Restore connection
5. Open app

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ
- Recent events bypass duplicate cache check
- Notifications shown for critical recent events
- No duplicate re-caching
- Smooth user experience

## Configuration

### Time Windows (Adjustable)

```dart
// Notification display window (default: 30 minutes)
final notificationWindow = DateTime.now().subtract(const Duration(minutes: 30));

// Recent event threshold for duplicate handling (default: 1 hour)
final oneHourAgo = DateTime.now().subtract(const Duration(hours: 1));

// Maximum backfill window (default: 12 hours)
const maxWindow = Duration(hours: 12);
```

### Critical Event Types

Events that trigger notifications:
- `overspeed` - Speed limit violations
- `ignitionon` - Engine started
- `ignitionoff` - Engine stopped
- `deviceonline` - Device reconnected
- `deviceoffline` - Device disconnected
- `geofenceenter` - Entered geofence
- `geofenceexit` - Exited geofence
- `alarm` - Alarm triggered

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Usage
- Duplicate event cache limited to 1000 most recent IDs
- Cached events pruned every 5 minutes
- Device name cache prevents excessive database queries

### Network Impact
- Backfill window capped at 12 hours maximum
- Per-device event fetching for efficiency
- Throttled to prevent rapid successive backfills (5-second minimum)

### Battery Impact
- Notifications only for critical event types
- Time-window filtering reduces processing
- Smart duplicate detection minimizes redundant work

## Monitoring & Debugging

[VehicleRepo] ‚úÖ Replayed 5 missed events
```

**Recent Event Processing**:
```
[NotificationsRepository] üîÑ Processing recent duplicate event 12345 for notifications only
[NotificationsRepository] üì§ Showing notification for backfilled event: ignitionOff (My Car)
```

## Summary

This fix ensures that users **always see notifications for important events that occurred during disconnection**, while preventing notification spam from old or duplicate events. The solution balances completeness, performance, and user experience through smart time-window filtering and duplicate handling.

**Key Improvement**: Users will now see notifications for critical events (ignition off, geofence entry/exit, device offline) that happened within the last 30 minutes, even if their phone was disconnected when those events occurred.
