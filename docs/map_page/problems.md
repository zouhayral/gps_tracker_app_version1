# App Optimization & Issues Report (Updated)

## ✅ 1. Marker Asset Migration (Fixed)

### Summary
- **Done:** Removed all `.png` marker fallbacks and migrated to `.svg` assets.
- **Files Updated:** `marker_assets.dart`, `pubspec.yaml`
- **New Test:** `marker_assets_smoke_test.dart` validates SVG asset preload.

### Verification
- Repository search confirmed no `.png` marker references remain.
- `flutter clean`, `flutter analyze`, and `flutter test` all ran successfully.
- Asset errors (`PathNotFoundException`) no longer appear in logs.
- Smoke test confirms `MarkerAssets.preload()` works without exceptions.

### Notes
- Remaining `.png` files belong only to:
  - External map tile URLs (`openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png`)
  - Platform/web icon assets (expected)
- **Next:** Fix unrelated test suite issues (ObjectBox native lib, pending timers).

## ✅⚙️ 2. FMTC Re-Initialization (fixed)

### Problem
Multiple `[FMTC][INIT] Using FMTC cached tile provider for store 'main'` log entries indicate repeated FMTC initialization.

### Objective
- Initialize FMTC only once globally (in `main.dart`).
- Ensure all map pages use `FMTCTileProvider.instance(storeName: 'main')`.

### Planned Fix
- Add FMTC initialization block in `main.dart` before `runApp()`.
- Remove redundant init calls inside providers/widgets.
- Optionally add test to confirm FMTC init runs once.

---

## 🛰️ 3. WebSocket Reconnection Loops (Planned)
### Problem
Repeated `[SOCKET] Attempting WebSocket connection…` logs indicate multiple socket instances being created.

### Objective
- Move WebSocket initialization into a persistent Riverpod provider.
- Ensure only one connection per app lifecycle.

---

## 🎨 4. Marker Rendering Performance (Planned)
### Problem
Complex glow and animation effects on each marker cause GPU jank.

### Objective
- Replace continuous glow animations with conditional shadows.
- Use `AnimatedScale` for smoother transitions.
- Enable clustering for large fleets.

---

## 💾 5. ObjectBox Query Blocking (Planned)
### Problem
Synchronous local DB access during rebuilds causes UI stalls.

### Objective
- Move ObjectBox queries to background isolate.
- Use Streams to push updates to the UI asynchronously.

---

## 🧪 6. Test Environment Fixes (New)

### Problem
Tests failed due to:
- Missing ObjectBox native library during test run.
- Pending `Timer` in `map_page_test.dart` after disposal.
- Some fake provider methods throwing `UnimplementedError`.

### Objective
- Skip or mock native ObjectBox tests in CI.
- Fix widget test teardown by awaiting `tester.pumpAndSettle()`.
- Implement missing fake provider stubs.

## 🧭 Recommended Next Step
✅ **Step 2: FMTC Optimization**
Run the AI Agent with the prompt titled  
**“Initialize FMTC Once Globally”**  
to clean up redundant FMTC calls and improve map loading performance.

Once that’s complete, we’ll move to **Step 3 (WebSocket lifecycle stabilization)**.
